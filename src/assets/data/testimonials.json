Our budget for specials is almost non-existant, which makes it difficult to provide a variety of learning opportunities. During the 2021-2022 school year, TLGYO provided our students with the supplies such as markers, adaptive scissors, piano books, & much more. TLGYO helped me create a better learning environment with more opportunities for my students. I am so grateful for the support my students and I received from TLGYO and look forward to partnering with them in the future.</p>"

Teachers at our school have a limited selection of items that we can choose from in our supply closet, but the amount that we are able to have in a given school year is very limited. TLGYO has provided my students with books on their reading level and a class set in which they will be able to use when we get our novel units. I was able to receive an instruction manual to go along with the novels that students will be reading as well so that I can be assured that I am challenging them every step of the way. I look forward to working with TLGYO again and appreciate the opportunities that they have given to my students this school year!</p>"
