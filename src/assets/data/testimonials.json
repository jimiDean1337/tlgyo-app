Our budget for specials is almost non-existant, which makes it difficult to provcide a variety of learning opportunities. During the 2021-2022 school year, TLGYO provided our students with the supplies such as markers, adaptive scissors, paino books, & much more. TLGYO helped me create a better learning environment with more opportunities for my students. I am so grateful for the support my students and I recieved from TLGYO and look forward to partnering with them in the future.</p>"
